# Hotel-Management-System
This is a hotel management system I created that manages a hotel's guests, bookings and accounts. This was programmed in C# and SQL

## Requirements
1. You must have a windows PC to run this program
2. I reccomend using Visual Studio for compiling the applications
3. Ensure that Visual Studio has the Ado.NET extensions installed

## How to Run
1. Open the workspace with Visual Studio
   Click the "Run/Play" button
2. OR use Hotel-Management-System/RestEasy_System/RestEasy_System/RestEasy_System/obj/Debug/RestEasy_System.exe
