# Hotel-Management-System
This is a hotel management system I created that manages a hotel's guests, bookings and accounts. This was programmed in C# and SQL

## Requirements
1. You must have a windows PC to run this program
2. As there is no executable file yet I reccomend using Visual Studio to compile the application. 
3. Ensure that Visual Studio has the Ado.NET extensions installed

## How to Run
Open the workspace with Visual Studio
Click the "Run/Play" button
